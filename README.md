# cifar10-image-classification-cnn-vs-ann
This repository explores CIFAR-10 image classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The models are trained and compared on Google Colab's T4 GPU to analyze performance differences between fully connected and convolutional architectures.
